This project was designed in React Redux. The app gets data from user, stores it and allows different components to retrieve the information.
I learned to use the store, action creator and reducer and realized that Redux lets us easily define reactive areas that respond online to each change in data. 
Also learned how to export Input Buttons to components folder and sreduce lines of duplicated code.
